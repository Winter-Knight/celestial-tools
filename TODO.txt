	- Mario should be distorted lines with storms
	- Maybe make IO and Shadow procedurally

		- Another moon with tiny moons of its own
		- A planet with a close orbit that can only be seen for a brief period per year
	- I want the sun to look like moving molten lava
* Cache shaders so they don't have to be compiled multiple times
* Cache textures so they don't have to be loaded multiple times
* Make a free system loosely based on sol system
* Make sure images are freely licensed and correctly documented
* Make as easy to use library
* publish library to github
* Documentation
	- Compiling (SKIP THIS TUTORIAL: Download binaries here)
	- Make a starbox (SKIP THIS TUTORIAL: Use the starbox found in /images/)
	- Make a solar system (SKIP THIS TUTORIAL: Use default system loosely based on sol system)
